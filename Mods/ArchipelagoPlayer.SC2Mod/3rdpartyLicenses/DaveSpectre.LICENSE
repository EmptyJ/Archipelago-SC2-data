Original credits go to Activision Blizzard and their respective authors. Most of my stuff is made from their models, textures and voicelines, which means, don't use my assets for any commercial purposes.
Otherwise you are free to use my models as you want including edits.
Crediting is not necessary as long as you don't claim the model as your own. For edited models, I'd like to be credited as original author.
